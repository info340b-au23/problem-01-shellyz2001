    <p>        
        Wang Miao, the protagonist in Cixin Liu's novel <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)">The Three-Body Problem</a></cite>, 
        is an eminent scientist specializing in nanotechnology. He was unwittingly drawn into a world of alien encounters and impending peril for humanity
        when he discovered that the unpredictable temperature and the sun's erratic behavior in the virtual reality game
        "Three-Body" mirror a real existence. As secrets unravel, Wang Miao undergoes profound transformations, immersing 
        himself in the depths of existential contemplation and embarking on an exploration of the universe's mysteries.
